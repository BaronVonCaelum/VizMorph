# VizMorph 🎯

**Standalone Desktop Application for Tableau Visualization Suggestions**

VizMorph analyzes your Tableau workbooks and suggests better visualization alternatives using intelligent heuristic rules. No installation, no server setup, no complexity - just download the executable and start improving your dashboards!

![VizMorph Interface](docs/vizmorph-preview.png)

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Download**: Get the latest `VizMorph.exe` from the [Releases](../../releases) page
2. **Run**: Double-click the executable (no installation needed!)
3. **Analyze**: Browse and select your Tableau workbook (.twb or .twbx)
4. **Discover**: Review intelligent visualization suggestions with confidence scores
5. **Export**: Save suggestions as D3.js, JSON, or Vega-Lite formats

## ✨ Key Features

- 🗂️ **Universal Tableau Support**: Works with .twb and .twbx files from any Tableau version
- 🧠 **9 Smart Heuristics**: Detects time series, correlations, hierarchies, geography, and more
- 📊 **10+ Chart Types**: Bar, line, scatter, treemap, heatmap, bubble, pie, histogram, box plot, area charts
- 📈 **Confidence Scoring**: Each suggestion rated 0-100% confidence with detailed reasoning
- 📋 **Multiple Exports**: JSON config, ready-to-use D3.js HTML, or Vega-Lite specifications
- 🔒 **Privacy First**: 100% local processing - your data never leaves your machine
- 🖥️ **Zero Dependencies**: Single 12MB executable, no Python/Node.js installation required

## 🎯 How It Works

### 1. Upload Your Workbook
- Supports both .twb (XML) and .twbx (packaged) files
- Automatically extracts worksheet structure and data mappings
- Analyzes dimensions, measures, filters, and visualization types

### 2. Intelligent Analysis
VizMorph applies 9 sophisticated heuristic rules:

| Rule | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Time Series** | Detects temporal dimensions | Suggests line charts for date-based data |
| **Correlation** | Finds multiple measures | Recommends scatter plots for relationships |
| **Categories** | Identifies high-cardinality data | Suggests treemaps for many categories |
| **Geography** | Detects location fields | Recommends geographic visualizations |
| **Distribution** | Analyzes data spread | Suggests histograms and box plots |
| **Hierarchy** | Finds nested structures | Recommends treemaps for drill-down |
| **Performance** | Identifies KPI data | Suggests bar charts for comparisons |
| **Part-to-Whole** | Detects proportional data | Recommends pie charts for percentages |
| **Multi-Measure** | Handles complex datasets | Suggests heatmaps for pattern detection |

### 3. Actionable Suggestions
Each suggestion includes:
- **Confidence Score** (0-100%): Algorithm's certainty level
- **Detailed Rationale**: Why this visualization is recommended
- **Expected Improvements**: Specific benefits over current approach
- **Data Mapping**: How fields should be assigned to visual elements

### 4. Export & Implement
Choose from multiple export formats:
- **JSON**: Complete configuration data
- **D3.js**: Ready-to-use HTML with interactive charts
- **Vega-Lite**: Industry-standard visualization grammar

## 🛠️ System Requirements

- **Operating System**: Windows 7/8/10/11 (64-bit)
- **Memory**: 4GB RAM minimum, 8GB recommended
- **Storage**: 100MB free disk space
- **Network**: None required (fully offline)

## 📁 Example Files

The `examples/` directory contains sample Tableau workbooks to test VizMorph:

- `Wildlife_Strikes.twbx` - Aviation safety dashboard with geographic and temporal data
- `Book_of_Calcs.twbx` - Complex calculations workbook with multiple chart types

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Q: Application won't start**
- Ensure you're on 64-bit Windows
- Check that antivirus isn't blocking the executable
- Try running as administrator

**Q: No suggestions generated**
- Verify your Tableau file contains actual worksheets with data
- Check that dimensions and measures are properly defined
- Ensure the workbook isn't corrupted

**Q: Export fails**
- Confirm you have write permissions in the target directory
- Check available disk space
- Try a different export format

**Q: Analysis takes too long**
- Large workbooks (>50MB) may take several minutes
- Consider breaking complex workbooks into smaller files
- Close other applications to free up memory
